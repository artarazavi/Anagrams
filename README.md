This is a project that I did for my Algorithms class.
The purpose of this program is to take in a file of strings and output the anagram classes

How to run:
javac proj1.java (to compile)
java proj1 [dict1/dict2] [anagram1.txt/ anagram2.txt] (to tell program where to get its input dictionary from and where to write it to)
